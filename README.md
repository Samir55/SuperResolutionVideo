[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Samir55/SuperResolutionVideo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Samir55/SuperResolutionVideo)

This project aims to get a super resolution video version out of a low resolution one. It makes use of the famous H.264 codec as it enhances the I-Frames.
 
This is WIP and in its early stages.

The implementation is based on "Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks" paper by "Chao Dong, Chen Change Loy, Kaiming He, Xiaoou Tang
"
